Simple code editor using Express, NodeJs, TinyMCE with some email templates/snippets.

Download or clone the repo, open the folder in the terminal and type npm install.

Open localhost:3000 in your browser and the fun will begin.

The editor gives the option to save the files which will be located in the folder "files", but you also can download the files after create them.

For any suggestion of improvement please email fernandofas@gmail.com.

Happy coding!!
